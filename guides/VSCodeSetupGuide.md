# VSCode Setup Guide

(make sure to have Git Bash downloaded before this)

VSCode is what we use to program our robot! This guide goes over:
* downloading Live Share
    * Live Share allows for multiple people to work on code at the same time, sort of like how Google Docs allows people to work in a document at the same time, after someone shares it!
* setting Git Bash as your default terminal
